# AWS Overview

## 1. Introduction to Cloud Computing

### What is Cloud Computing?

**Definition:** Delivery of computing services (servers, storage, databases, networking, software, etc.) over the internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.

### Key Characteristics:
- **On-demand Self-Service:** Resources can be provisioned without human interaction.
- **Broad Network Access:** Available over the internet via various devices.
- **Resource Pooling:** Resources shared among multiple customers.
- **Elasticity:** Scale up/down based on demand.
- **Measured Service:** Pay-as-you-go pricing.

### Benefits of Cloud Computing:
- Cost efficiency
- Scalability
- Flexibility and mobility
- Security enhancements
- Innovation and agility

## 2. Different Types of Cloud Models

### Cloud Deployment Models:
- **Public Cloud:** Services offered over the public internet (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).
- **Private Cloud:** Dedicated resources for a single organization.
- **Hybrid Cloud:** Combination of public and private clouds for flexibility.

### Service Models:

#### IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):
- Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.
- **Example:** AWS EC2, Azure Virtual Machines.

#### PaaS (Platform as a Service):
- Provides a platform to develop, test, and deploy applications without managing underlying infrastructure.
- **Example:** AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Azure App Services.

#### SaaS (Software as a Service):
- Delivers software applications over the internet.
- **Example:** Gmail, Microsoft 365.
